    * Robust client-side form validation to ensure data integrity and enhance user experience.
    * Modal dialogs for user feedback and notifications, providing a seamless interaction.
* **Back-end:**
    * RESTful API for managing core entities: users, products, categories, and orders.
    * Secure user authentication and authorization to protect user data and control access.
    * Product catalog management with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities (category, price, sales).
